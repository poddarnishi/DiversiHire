Thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself. My name is [Your Name], and I am currently in my final year at [University Name], pursuing a degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. Throughout my academic career, I have been passionate about understanding what drives consumer behavior and how businesses can create strategies to meet their needs effectively. This interest led me to participate in various marketing competitions and workshops, where I developed a keen sense of market trends and customer engagement strategies.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have actively sought out practical experiences. Last summer, I completed an internship at [Previous Internship Company], where I was involved in a project aimed at improving the company's digital marketing strategy. This experience taught me a lot about teamwork, project management, and the importance of data-driven decision-making.

I am particularly excited about the Sales Intern position at [Company Name] because it aligns perfectly with my career aspirations and my desire to contribute to a team that prioritizes innovation and excellence. I am eager to bring my background in marketing, along with my enthusiasm for sales and customer relations, to your team. I am confident that my proactive approach and willingness to learn will make a positive impact on your sales initiatives.
